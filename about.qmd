# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm naam is Tom

I'm passionate about data-driven impact, with experience in research, project management, and client relations across agriculture, renewable energy, and micro-finance.

I enjoy translating ideas into action, delivering meaningful end-to-end programs, solving complex challenges with cross-functional teams, fostering collaboration through engaging meetings, and building shared value relationships with communities, partners, and donors/investors.

Outside of work, I enjoy music, football, Formula One, and a lot of other sports.

At the moment, I am exploring roles that focus on:

- **Health Sciences:** research, data analytics, bioinformatics
- **Project Delivery:** within development sectors
- **Innovation:** pilots, initiatives, processes
- **Strategy & Transformation**
- **Data Management**

I am also open to interesting conversations about where I can add value!
